Conclusion:
- Our degree distribution does not follow a power law, being more closely related to a normal distribution.
- Despite this, we can still see the presence of Hubs in the network which wouldn't happen in a random network


Todo:
- We should better understand the generated values by fitting the data into a power law:
alpha(10.43584815827752) sigma(1.308516706237002) loglikelihoodRatio(-0.9185063058809141)
pVal(0.16159229772218375)

- We should verify the existance of factors that prove the non-existance of the small world effect.

- We should also investigate the robustness of the grid

Maybe:
- Should we had more nodes in a random way to verify it's scalability
